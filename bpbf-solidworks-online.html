I will soon be leaving university for several years for personal reasons (I'm planning on returning at some point). During the next few years I want to study and improve my Solidworks skills. I currently have a CSWA and pretty much master the basic modeling tools (including assembly and drawing). I would like to deepen my knowledge in more advanced tools such as surfacing and simulations, and get a CSWP and maybe some CSWPA.

Having certifications on my mind and seeing a recent post for the same, I thought of going to mysolidworks and checking out what it is about. Apparently they have 350+ lessons and 8 e-courses, with many of those courses bundled into "learning paths". Sounds like a nice idea, right? The thing is that all the e-courses and 181 of those lessons are only for SW Pro license holders - which wouldn't be so bad, and totally understandable in fact - were they not chosen almost at random.

He took CAD I/mechanical drawing and has a uArm PRO with the 3D printer and laser engraver to make things. But Solidworks seems to be the 'go to' program these days. Will the Autodesk 123 class give him what he needs to have cross platform versatility so can adapt to a Solidworks environment or another current/full featured program? Or should he do Solidworks online/self-paced and take the AP class (Environmental Studies)? I guess the question is really: does a CAD class using dated Autodesk. 
I won't go into details as to why my version is lost - other than my HD has crashed - but I was wondering who has experience with the cloud-based design programs (Onshape/Fusion 360/Other???) and how do they relate to Solidworks from a transition standpoint. The job I'm applying to needs strong experience in CATIA. But I've had 2+ years of Solidworks experience and wanted to know whether I'd be able to make myself prepared for the job or CAD test they may throw at me as part of the interview process. Our company is trying to implement Solidworks as our primary CAD coming from AutoCAD 2008. We run into glitches and roadblocks in trying to do simple things. Why is it so hard to find good information in forums? Is Solidworks paying Google or others to keep information more locked away so that you have to pay them for yearly tech support?? There's no way there are only a couple relevant posts per Google search for what should be common problems. Hello guys. Do you have any suggestions on how to get started with Solidworks. Hi! I am new here. I would like to seek for your help on how I can acquire a Solidworks license. I wish to learn Solidworks because I believe that it can help me with my equipment failure studies and investigations. By the way, I work as a mechanical inspector and unfortunately, our company has no access to it, since our comapny still don't see the need for it. Also, I cannot afford to buy one. I also wish to take the Certified Solidworks Associate exam after learning the software. I believe. So I've been hunting around for CAD software that isn't cloud based and isn't subscription based. And I've wound up upon FreeCAD and OpenSCAD and thats pretty much it. Are there any sort of allternatives that I'm missing, cause FreeCAD is excruciatingly difficult to use in terms of a UI/UX experience, from what I've seen Fusion 360 has a much nicer UI but. I take personal issue to software which is subscription based for no seemingly legitimate reason (like CAD software), and I don't 
I'd like to add SolidWorks to our current business lineup of Pro/Engineer Wildfire CAD software. Our company makes a few of our own products and also does contract manufacturing. The Pro/E CAM manufacturing extension works well for our mills, lathes, EDM and sheet metal, but the learning curve to produce models is a stretch for most of our machinists in this environment. I feel SolidWorks might be better fit for simpler parts coupled with MasterCAM down the road. I'm considering the Student. Hey guys, We are thinking of purchasing a Solidworks 2018 standard license for one of our engineers. He has both a desktop for his daily work and laptop when away traveling. My question is, will he be able to use his Solidworks 2018 license on both his laptop and desktop (Not simultaneously)? Thanks for your feedback. I have used Solid Edge for over 12 years at my last job and have been using Solidworks since January at my new job. Now they have given me a project that requires using Creo 2.0 and boy am I struggling. Granted, I have been thrown into the deep end with no training whatsoever, but I'm generally smart and experienced enough to feel my way around some other unfamiliar software. Not this one; this is the most cumbersome and inefficient drafting program I've been working with SolidWorks for a while and am looking to get more training. My VAR offers a Sheet Metal class but my company won't let me travel for training, so I was hoping to find something online. I looked at SolidProfessor, but I was hoping to get something more lab-based like a classroom course or other classes I've taken with VARs. Have any of you tried online training by a var or other companies that do online? Any recommendations would be appreciated so much! Thanks! Any recomm. I have the opportunity to continue working with my summer internship throughout my last semester and possibly get an engineering position after graduation but the commute from campus is 1.5 hours there and 1.5 hours back. I can work that out but I want to take an autocad or solidworks course because that is what I would be doing a lot of at this company. Also, I have heard some universities offer an "internship or research" course for 3 credit hours where you basically just continue your inter. Hey! So I am a senior in mechanical engineering, graduating in May. I really want to become a design engineer or R&D engineer. My school’s curriculum did not really do a good job of preparing me to do complex 3D modeling. I only know the basic features like extrude, cut, etc. Are there any online sources or places I could learn through mini projects or assignments? or I could get a certification that would help me add to my resume? I would really like to learn through a course or something. NOT looking for Youtube tutorials. I watched all of them already, and they do not assist me with the pitfalls I encounter with HSMworks. I would prefer hands-on training from a professional, so I can have my specific questions answered.
