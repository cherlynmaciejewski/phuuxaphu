Is this possible? Basically I am looking at creating a website that has video embedded on it, whereby somehow on the server I can set a video playlist from the videos stored on there or AWS (or some cloud platform) that will play throughout the day. Much like a TV channel, the user would load the page and see what is playing at that particular moment. I have looked at a bunch of different ways to do this, and not really found any solutions. If anyone has any idea's as to how to achieve. Adobe® Media Server 5 Standard software lets you reach a broad video audience on Adobe Flash® Player compatible and iOS devices.

Hi everyone My issue is that I am trying to build two sites (my wife told me I should make them, which is really cool), one site is a picture and streaming video site, the other is a cam site. The problem is where can I host them, I dont have a lot of money right now, just trying to get something started. I have almost a year left on my Godaddy hosting for some other sites, although they allow adult content (as long as its legal, which it is) they do not allow ffmpeg unless Powered by Create your own unique website with customizable templates.

Hi all I'm new to this subreddit and a total newb when it comes to servers. However, I've always wanted to have my own server where I could upload videos and things of that nature. I have some spare cash for this project and I'm looking to learn as this will be a side project to keep me busy. I wanted to know if reddit could help me get started and where to go. So I basically want to create a server where I can store videos that can be accessed through a password protected website(that Sorry, catchy and seems pertinent :) This is therapy for me, since seems obvious that given the time is approaching a year when he said it was coming, and has not. Tired of app and media juggling, so stopped buying apps. Update: The reason for the question mark is I’m asking is that what happened. If I could edit the title, it would be: Was Carmack lied to, so local storage died too? Not as catchy, but less rude. I should have at least put Did at the beginning of the title. Agreed comes. SFGLive 3.0 BETA Stream Start Time :--- :-- Offline 12:05 PST \ I worked hard to bring this to you guys and all I ask in return is for you to please not to share the link outside of /r/sfgiants If the video does not play, please disable any ad blocking software and refresh the page. Once the video starts playing, you may re-enable your ad blocking software. You do not need to install anything special, just have Adobe Flash and you should be good to go. Stream 
So I carry a couple flash drives with me daily, one with a live Ubuntu image. The other just a scratch disk. I was wondering if you guys carried I run the following on my desktop computer under Windows 8.1u1 Pro. I plan on moving this to a dedicated server so I can leave my desktop computer off. Imgur ( What I primarily use this setup for: Web development and teaching myself web-based programming-- Javascript, CSS, HTML, PHP, Python. Streaming music and videos when I'm away from home through Subsonic media server. Flash Media Server for video streaming. Hosting a Minecraft and Starbound. Comparing Ultraedit and Adobe Flash Media Server. Ultraedit installs fine on anything. Adobeshit installs on some machines and blatantly fails on others. Turns it doesn't add Firewall rules - you need to do that manually. Admittedly I'm using the trial version, but I doubt the 5 full version would be any better. And in general the more you pay for software, the more chance you'll find it has severe installation issues. 
I read the faq and understand that video stuttering is an issue with my network but for most episodes that i've watched using the alpha server's flash player the audio didn't. Went to play the new Spider-Man off a disc, there was a 60 GB space requirement on my PS4 to play. I have the original 400GB size PS4 and had to remove another game file (RIP Uncharted 4) to make room. This is in comparison to RDR2 from the PS store at 100GB (over 25% of my storage space). Why even bother with discs anymore when there isn’t a difference in file size? What is being stored on the disc if 60GB is going to the console? Do companies assume we are all just grabbing from the PS store. I work in IT but mostly on the networking side. I just brought home a decommissioned R320 from work and I want to use it as a vSphere host in my home lab. I’ve done some googling and I’ve found bits and pieces of useful information but is there a good tutorial out there that anybody could recommend that’s geared toward helping new users get set up from scratch? I’ve used vSphere a lot but I’ve never had the opportunity to set up a host myself. I have actually not done much work directly. I have a t1.micro dedicated to running a rtmp server (rtmplite.py) for a personal live video conferencing solution between my girlfriend and I. After a while one of our video streams always freezes and I have to restart the RTMP server to getting things working again. Looking at CloudWatch: CPU rtmp server running but on standby: ~8% CPU single video stream in: ~56% CPU two video streams in and out: 100% So it looks like the problems due to not enough CPU power. I tried reformatting to FAT with same options but it still cant read the card. Are there any other settings I may have messed with after the format? I have other working CF cards is it possible to "clone" them? Edit: When I plug in the card to the server it says "card not ready". A client of mine has a tv station's camera set up and they'd like to get the video from said camera on their website. The camera is connected to a PC using a USB capture card (startech svid2usb22). It is my understanding that they want this feed to be up 24/7. Is a provider like UStream sufficient for this (always-on streaming)? Or will they need to invest in Flash Media Server? Or is there another way to get the video feed embedded on the site? I'm not sure of the best way to go about. I purchased an online course, only to discover that you don't get the video files, rather an RTMP stream to which access is only granted for 30 days. Needless to say, I'm not too happy about this. I'm having problems downloading the stream with RTMP however, getting an ERROR: Closing connection: NetStream.Failed message. I'm a little confused as to what parameters to use given the video is behind a login and presumably uses some kind of authentication as well. Here's what I know: Video. </p>
