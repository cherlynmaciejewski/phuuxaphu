Human multitasking is an apparent human ability to perform more than one task, or activity, at the same time. An example of multitasking is taking phone calls while typing an email and reading I am not kinda good when it comes to messenging/texting since I prefer direct talking much more. However, because I and the girl I like/crush on have little time meet up on the outside, I have to use messenger as replacement(for some reasons she can't use voice/video call). I feel like it hard to keep our conversation fun enough to keep her attention as well as it would be a nuisance for her if I keep texting her like almost everyday(We both have work on weekdays so I prefer the day off we spend. This girl I’ve known since 5th grade has shown interest in me recently. She’s made plans with me, messaged me in the morning, yada yada. The thing is she is SO very bad at texting back. For instance, yesterday she messaged me at 4:30 pm asking if I was doing anything tomorrow night (today). Then just stopped replying. It’s just mixed messages man and it’s a bit frustrating. I’ve never been one to chase someone but I’ve had a crush on her for the longest time and I don’t know what to do. TL;DR. I matched with someone on Bumble a couple of weeks ago. She doesn't message often through the app so it took me about 2 weeks before I got her number and both agreed to go hiking this past weekend. The hike was about 4 hours in total, nothing too strenuous. Honestly, it only felt like an hour at most since I was having a lot of fun getting to know her. We went to go grab something to eat after the hike and talk for another hour there an parted ways. We had a lot of things in common and I really. How do you all deal with a bad texter ? I'm getting used to my gf not texting a whole lot and I'm okay with it. There is no need to communicate 24/7. Id rather maybe just a few texts throughout the day and if I don't see her maybe a call at night for 15 or so minutes before bed. She says she is bad at responding a lot, which I get people are busy. It's just weird I haven't heard from her since last night around 8 (it's now 2pm) I had sent 1 text after a few hours then called I met a guy off tinder. We had three dates over three weeks with very minimal chit chat between dates. 1st date: at a bar and we had a couple drinks. Seemed normal and we both had fun. 2nd date: Brunch. Lots of joking around. He told me about all the flirting he does with his female coworkers, and also complained about a girl friend that kept wanting to hang out with him one on one. He admitted she was pretty and smart but did not want to pursue a relationship 
I (20F) have been seeing this guy (22M) around since september but we only formally met last Monday. When we met we chatted for ~30 minutes and I let him do most of the talking, he is a great conversationalist. Toward the end of the conversation he asked me what my schedule is like and if I'm really busy this semester, and me being clueless responded by saying "yeah I'm pretty busy, you?". I had him on instagram so I messaged him there after and eventually gave him my number (he didn't Hey bros, throw away account here and looking for advice.(I'm 28 yo) I’ve been “hanging out” with a really cute guy the same age as me for about 2 months now (1-3 times a week now). He also has a great personality when we text (more on that below) and see each other. One could say that I'm starting to fall for him. Anyways, what I’m having trouble with is trying to get him to respond back to texts in general - almost to the point where I thought he was ghosting me early  We met online and have been seeing each other for just over a month now, around 5 dates so far. Neither of us have asked about exclusivity because it's too soon I think. Every time we meet, we have a really great time and we're getting along really well so far. We do fun things, we have slept together and he suggests fun date ideas rather than just going for dinner or watching netflix every time, which I have experienced a lot in the past with other guys. So everything is pretty much going. 
Context: We are both co-workers who were a little lonely at the time so we decided to hook up. It's been four months and we love each others company, but then the spark started to fade pretty quick. I'm Asian as fuck and she's Mexican as fuck, so there is a race barrier. Me, I'm really bad at texting. I had zero friends growing up, so I don't know how convo's should be like over text. She is honestly my first true friend. She's also the very first girl I've ever held hands with, kissed All responses are short winded Does anyone else have the issue of a busy day and not being able to text? I told a guy I was talking to that I had to go get my hair done which was an hour away from where I live and that I was hanging out with my parents. My parents were helping me with a new headboard and getting landscape rock. Again this was communicated as hey I’m going to be busy today and not around my phone much with what I was doing. I just sat down after getting done with everything and had 8 different multiple paragra. Any bad texters out there able to explain why you’re bad at it? I’ve been on a few dates with this girl and she was pretty good at getting back to me in the beginning but it’s gone downhill since. She’s still down to go on dates with me, and it feels like we hit it off really well in person. On the last one I asked if she was into me just to make sure, and she said she definitely was. I’m not a big texter either, but I try to reply to people when I get the chance. She on the other hand won’t. I have completed over 140 hours and 570 conversations! I'm here at answer your questions about Crisis Text Line. Proof, Letter of Verification (blacked out last name for privacy): https://imgur.com/CZWEozo (https://imgur.com/CZWEozo). I'm drunk, which is rare. I miss my wife. She really is my favorite person in the entire world. We aren't talking right now. She is in Reno for a friend's birthday. I can't help but miss her. We are not doing well as a couple , but I still love her more than life. I just needed to say it. It's off my chest. That's all I needed. We went on a couple dates before we got intimate. First date was at a bar, second date an aquarium, and I took her out for her birthday to a comedy club for the 3rd. Each date she got a present (first one was a glass that came with the drink, second one an octopus plushie, 3rd a Rick and Morty pop). I also made her a Spotify playlist. I know it’s probably a little much but as far as I could tell she seemed into it. Every Sunday she comes over and watches game of thrones 
I was sent a form to sign up to volunteer and was told I would receive an email with more info. The texter told me to go to the rally at a certain time for volunteering. Should I still go even though I didn't get the email. I recent got a girl’s number and I don’t want to bore her with my bad texting skills. You guys got any tips I can use to keep her interested or start/keep a good conversation going. So I've been online dating on and off for 3 years now. I've given up for a long stretch because, well, it's such a fucking crapshoot of flakes. But I have a list of red flags compiled and I was wondering if anyone else had the same. One of which being the people that want to meet up before even getting to know you over text. It's almost like they are just bored and looking to kill some time for an evening, or they're looking for a hookup. amp#x200B; This week, Saturday, I started talking. I’ve done it and I’ve felt like shit for it. I’ve tried to not do it as often because I can only imagine that I made somebody feel the same as I do now. It makes me feel like all the jokes I make and times I make them laugh in person, yes I’m talking about after hanging out and going on dates not just messaging mean absolutely nothing. Be the bigger person and just say something, let them know it’s not them and your just not interested.
